## About The Project

This project is an integration of Webex and Strava. Strava is a fitness application that tracks user's activities, posts and other details. @Ridebuddy is a bot created for tracking Strava user's recent activities and club's leaderboard inside webex. This bot provides details about a charity bike ride that includes both physical and virtual participants from all over the world. This integration helped users to be a part of the charity ride from wherever they are and raise donations for **Macmillan Cancer Support** and **Mind**.
